# CanvasModule — Metal Drawing Engine

## Critical Rules (NEVER violate)

### sRGB Premultiplied Alpha — The Bidirectional CIImage Rule

The canvas uses `.bgra8Unorm_srgb` Metal textures. The `_srgb` suffix means Metal's blend pipeline works in **linear** space: it decodes sRGB→linear on read, blends, then encodes linear→sRGB on write. The stored premultiplied values are `sRGB_encode(linear_R × alpha)`.

**CGContext premultiplies in sRGB space** (`sRGB_R × alpha`), which is mathematically different. Any CGImage↔Metal round-trip through CGContext darkens semi-transparent pixels because `sRGB(R_linear × α) ≠ sRGB(R_linear) × α`. The darkening is **cumulative** — each round-trip makes it worse.

**ALWAYS use CIImage + CIContext for BOTH directions:**

| Direction | Correct | WRONG (causes darkening) |
|---|---|---|
| Metal→CGImage | `CIImage(mtlTexture:)` → `CIContext.createCGImage()` | `texture.getBytes()` → `CGDataProvider` → `CGImage(...)` |
| CGImage→Metal | `CIImage(cgImage:)` → `CIContext.render(_:to:commandBuffer:bounds:colorSpace:)` | `CGContext.draw(image)` → `texture.replace(region:withBytes:)` |

CIContext is cached on `CanvasRenderer` (created once at init, backed by the same MTLDevice). Both CIImage paths handle sRGB↔linear conversion and premultiplied alpha correctly.

**Y-flip:** CIImage uses bottom-left origin; Metal textures use top-left. Apply `CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 1, y: -1).translatedBy(x: 0, y: -extent.height)` when converting in either direction.

### Performance — Main Thread Budget

Target: <8ms per frame at 120 Hz. Three rules:

1. **NEVER `drawHierarchy(afterScreenUpdates: true)`** on MetalCanvasView. Forces synchronous GPU pipeline drain (10-50ms). Use `texture.getBytes()` on `.shared` textures or CIImage for CPU reads.

2. **NEVER `waitUntilCompleted()`** on per-frame or per-touch command buffers. Blocks main thread. Commit async; rely on Metal same-queue ordering. Only acceptable at stroke-end (`flattenScratchIntoCanvas`) or canvas-resize (`clearTexture`).

3. **Use `.shared` storage** for canvas textures on Apple Silicon. Unified memory = CPU and GPU share physical memory. `getBytes()`/`replace()` are coherent with no staging buffers. `.private` causes assertion failures on CPU access.

### Pixel Format

Always `.bgra8Unorm_srgb` for canvas textures. iOS's native compositor format is BGRA little-endian. Using RGBA or big-endian forces a CPU byte-swap on every composite → <1 fps.

For CGBitmapContext (undo snapshots only — raw bytes, no color interpretation): `premultipliedFirst | byteOrder32Little` = BGRA in memory. This matches the texture's raw byte layout, so `snapshotCanvas()`/`restoreCanvas()` are lossless round-trips (no CIImage needed for raw byte undo).

## Architecture

```
MetalCanvasView (UIView, CAMetalLayer)
├── CanvasRenderer (Metal state: device, pipelines, textures, shaders)
│   ├── canvasTexture (.bgra8Unorm_srgb, .shared) — persistent drawing surface
│   ├── scratchTexture — active stroke preview (cleared each frame)
│   ├── brushMaskTexture (R8Unorm, 64×64 soft circle)
│   ├── brushStampPSO — instanced quads, source-over blend
│   ├── eraserStampPSO — instanced quads, destination-out blend
│   ├── compositorPSO — fullscreen quad, source-over (layer compositing)
│   └── flattenPSO — fullscreen quad, destination-out (eraser flatten)
├── Stamp generation (CPU: arc-length resample, adaptive spacing)
├── Touch handling (coalesced touches, per-tool dispatch)
├── Undo (raw byte snapshots via getBytes/replace, depth 30)
└── Lasso (CAShapeLayer preview, CIImage extraction, CIContext composite)
```

### Brush rendering flow
1. Touch points → `StrokePoint` array (pressure, altitude, position)
2. Arc-length resample with **adaptive spacing** (`max(effectiveWidth × 0.3, 0.5)`) — tighter at low pressure so light strokes don't scatter into dots
3. Per-stamp: `StampInstance` (center, radius, rotation, premultiplied color)
4. All stamps → shared `MTLBuffer` → single instanced draw call into scratch texture
5. Compositor pass: canvas + scratch → drawable
6. On touchesEnded: flatten scratch into canvas (source-over for brush, destination-out for eraser)

### Eraser flow (different from brush)
- Stamps applied **directly to canvas texture** per touchesMoved (not via scratch)
- Uses temporary `MTLBuffer` per batch (`device.makeBuffer(bytes:)`) — no shared-buffer races
- Commits **without** `waitUntilCompleted` — async, same-queue ordering
- Undo snapshot pushed at touchesBegan (before any erasing), popped on cancel

### Persistence
- Canvas saved as **PNG bitmap** (via `canvasToCGImage()` → `pngData()`), not stroke JSON
- Restored via `loadDrawingData()` → `loadImageIntoCanvas()` (CIContext.render path)
- Legacy stroke JSON is auto-detected and replayed as fallback
- Stroke data kept in memory for potential future use (time-lapse, editing)

### Lasso flow
- Path preview: two `CAShapeLayer`s (white + black offset dashes) — Core Animation, off Metal hot path
- Extraction: CIImage read → CG composite+clip+crop → floating selection UIImage
- Clear: CG draw with .clear blend → `loadImageIntoCanvas` (CIContext.render)
- Commit: `compositeSelectionImage` → CG draw at transform → `loadImageIntoCanvas`
- Cancel: undo to pre-lasso snapshot
